## Steps to Set Up CodePipeline:

1. Create a New Pipeline:
   - Go to the AWS CodePipeline console and click Create Pipeline.
   - Name your pipeline (e.g., `MyWebsitePipeline`).

2. Source Stage:
   - Select GitHub as your source.
   - Connect your GitHub account and select the repository and branch that contains your website's source files (`index.html` and `error.html`).

3. Build Stage (Optional):
   - Since this project consists of static files, you can skip the build stage by selecting Skip build stage.

4. Deploy Stage:
   - Choose Amazon S3 as the deployment provider.
   - Select the S3 bucket that hosts your website.

5. Finalize:
   - Review and create the pipeline. Now, any changes pushed to GitHub will trigger a pipeline execution and automatically update your website on S3.

## Testing the Pipeline:

1. Edit the `index.html` file in your GitHub repository.
2. Commit the changes to the `main` branch.
3. Check AWS CodePipeline to see the deployment process in action.
4. Once completed, visit your website URL to see the changes live.
