## Steps to Configure CloudFront:

1. Create CloudFront Distribution:
   - Go to the CloudFront console and click on Create Distribution.
   - Choose Web for the delivery method.
   - Under Origin Domain Name, select the S3 bucket where your website is hosted.
   - Set Viewer Protocol Policy to Redirect HTTP to HTTPS.
   - Enable Cache Behavior for static content like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

2. Configure SSL (Optional):
   - If you have a custom domain, request or import an SSL certificate in AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).
   - Attach the certificate to the CloudFront distribution for HTTPS.

3. Associate CloudFront with Route 53 (Optional):
   - If using Route 53, add a CNAME or alias record pointing to your CloudFront distribution for your custom domain.

4. Invalidation for Cache Updates:
   - When you update the website in S3, invalidate the CloudFront cache to immediately reflect the changes.

5. Logging and Monitoring:
   - Enable CloudFront logging and monitoring in Amazon CloudWatch for performance insights and security.
